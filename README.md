# Weekly-Project-1-U2--Java

This is the first weekly project of the second unit of Epicode's backend bootcamp in Java.
We were instructed to create an application to allow reservations for a working environment.

The project is built in Java (17) and Spring and use external libraries such as:
  - Lombok;
  - JavaFaker;
  - PostgreSQL driver;
  - Spring Data JPA;
  
The project is built around 4 differents classes:
  1. User -> owner of reservation
  2. Building -> provider of the workstation
  3. Workstation -> the object to book for
  3. Reservation -> class to bind user and workstation
